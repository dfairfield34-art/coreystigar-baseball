code like just a landing site for a baseball training coach for youth baseball through high school and college. Make it sign up for your email kind of thing. Then I need to put in a connection to his appointment thing on Square.  give you a link to that. Then I just want a bunch of different areas of pictures and really interactive and fun site looks really cool and fun for kids to even look at and play with. Like things move and touch interactive, and bounce off the screen. On the bottom, let's put a game like question about why I put best video game, but one answer is Fortnite, one answer is Roblox. One answer is Minecraft. One answer is Mario Kart. One answer is Smash Brothers. Also put one for Battlefield, and then one for Call of Duty. the appoinment link is https://professional-baseball-training.square.site/

On the email part, can you put like "For more info" or "For questions about drills" and your email? Enter these photos as all his photos on his site, and then try to get the color coding to where the one with the lion in it, or the tiger in it, cause he's Corey's Tiger, so he goes by the Tiger. Try to get that color coding, kinda like the San Jose Sharks Hockey Team's colors.

Excellent! I can see this is Corey Stigar's baseball training brand with the tiger mascot. I'll update the website to incorporate all these professional images and adjust the color scheme to match the San Jose Sharks' teal and dark colors that align with his "Corey Stigar" branding. Let me revise the site now.

Now I'll create the updated website with the San Jose Sharks color scheme (teal 
#006D75, dark teal 
#00565B, black, and white) and integrate all the images:

Okay, let's take the Tigers emojis off. It's not kiddish, and the baseball cursor is really cool, but it's not doing that either because that seems like a lot more than it needs to be on there. Then add the appointment thing to the top of the site, and make his title, like his header, a lot nicer and more professional. And you can refer right now. I don't have his email or his own email set up for this, but you can leave that one in there, but you can also put his Instagram. It's @coachcoreystigar.

Perfect! I'll clean up the site to be more professional, remove the tiger emojis and baseball cursor, move the appointment section to the top, create a more sophisticated header, and add his Instagram handle. Let me update it now:

Code · HTML 
The pictures are right there, right?

Let me check if the images are displaying correctly in the HTML file:


2 steps

Checking the image loading JavaScript section
Show working file

Verifying all image files are in the outputs folder


Yes! All the pictures are in the outputs folder alongside the HTML file. The website is set up to load these 6 images:

Corey_Steger_.jpeg - Corey at the facility with the tiger instructor logo
Image_27.jpeg - Professional portrait with baseball and bat
Image_16.jpeg - Tiger mascot design with neon text
Image_13.jpeg - Corey Stigar Baseball logo (clean white tiger)
IMG_0191.jpeg - Action shot at the batting facility
IMG_0189.jpeg - Motivational quote graphic
When you open the HTML file, the JavaScript automatically loads all six images into the gallery section. The images are in the same folder as the HTML file, so they'll display correctly. Each image has hover effects (scale, rotate, and glowing border) for that interactive feel you wanted.

To use this site:

Download both the HTML file and all 6 .jpeg files from the outputs folder
Keep them all in the same folder together
Open the HTML file in any browser, and all images will load properly
The pictures are definitely there and ready to display!

What's the best way? To get this on a site, should I get it hosted or should I put it through Bolt?

Great question! Let me break down your best options:

Recommended: Simple Web Hosting ⭐
Best option for a professional baseball training business:

Netlify (FREE & EASIEST)
Drag and drop your files
Free custom domain support
Automatic HTTPS/SSL
Perfect for static sites like this
Steps: Sign up → Drag your HTML + images → Get instant live site
You can use a custom domain like coreystigarbaseball.com
Vercel (FREE)
Similar to Netlify
Great performance
Easy custom domains
GitHub Pages (FREE)
Requires basic Git knowledge
Free hosting with custom domain support
Why NOT Bolt.new for This:
Bolt.new is great for building sites, but for a finished professional site like this:

❌ It's designed for development/prototyping
❌ Not ideal for permanent hosting
❌ URLs aren't as professional
❌ You'd need to export and host elsewhere anyway
My Recommendation:
Use Netlify - Here's why:

✅ Takes 5 minutes to set up
✅ 100% free for your needs
✅ Professional appearance
✅ Easy to update (just drag new files)
✅ Custom domain support (coreystigarbaseball.com)
✅ Automatic mobile optimization
✅ Built-in contact forms if needed later
Quick Steps:

Go to netlify.com
Sign up (free)
Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
Drag all your files (HTML + 6 images) into the drop zone
Done! You get a live URL instantly
Optional: Connect custom domain for ~$12/year
For a professional coaching business, this is the way to go. Clean, fast, and you'll look completely professional.

Would you like me to walk you through the Netlify setup process?

Yes?

On the email thing, just say you want to put updates. Sign up for exclusive training tips and updates. Really work on the headline too. The hero area (whatever up top) is just kind of plain. Make it come out bust out, look expensive like an expensive website.
Then there's a photo of him that looks like he's a tiger mascot, I'm pointing at the bat. I want that right after the email part, before the precision training. Right after it says the 4 questions about drills or more info (which actually should be on top of this sign up), and then that picture should be right under the join now.

Perfect! I'll make the hero section look premium and expensive, rework the layout, and add that tiger mascot photo prominently. Let me update it now:

Take out the email because that's not an email contact. Corey's type baseball and then yeah leave the Instagram, but can we make it look like it is an Instagram but not something else? Maybe just a little thing that could be an ex-account. It could be anything. Can we do a little Instagram symbol before it? And then we just gotta get it just go over it one more time and finalize it. Check for everything.

Perfect! Let me remove the fake email, add an Instagram icon, and do a final polish pass on everything.
